# Matrix Operations Library - `matrixlib_2`

This project is a C++ static library that supports advanced matrix operations including:

- Sparse matrix representation
- Matrix addition, transposition, and multiplication
- LU decomposition
- QR decomposition
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Eigenvalue computation using the Power Iteration method
